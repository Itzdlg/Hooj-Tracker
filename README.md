### Project Purpose
Currently, Woohoojin is using a bare-bones note tracking webapp that syncs with a Google Sheet. In my opinion, this is not sufficient. Furthermore, while I have no good webapps on my portfolio, I've decided to create this app.

## Project Goals
The goal is to develop the following features:
- Game Library
  - Manually record games like a spreadsheet-like system
  - Link a video from Media Library to each game
  - Link playbook(s) from Playbook Library to each game
  - Simple filters on recorded games
  - *No bad stats such as HS% will be included*
- Practice Library
  - Track warm-up and practice session results
  - Link a video from Media Library to each session
- Media Library
  - Link Youtube (and perhaps other mediums) videos
    - Youtube sync from playlist?
- Playbook Library
  - Link ValoPlant or Image playbooks
    - Include notes
  - Share playbook so it can be copied by others via link
  - Public Woohoojin Playbook Library (to replace the discord forum)
- Reviews
  - Send a game from Game Library to be reviewed
  - Each review is moderated by designated staff and can be approved/denied like on Discord
  - Reviewer Notes
    - General, Offense, Defense, Tasks (checklist)
- Video Player
  - Timestamped notes (like Metafy and Insights.gg)
    - Separate notes by Woohoojin (or other Reviewers)
    - Students can take notes before sending for review

- User Dashboard
  - Quick '+ Game' '+ Warm Up' '+ Practice'
  - Recent Games
    - Include games from RSO & allow for manual sync if not auto sync
  - Review Status
    - Show the status of games pending review
